# Evaluation Methodology

Our evaluation employs a multi-faceted approach, focusing on how well the system assists software engineers. We break down the evaluation into the system's core components (retrieval and generation) and assess its real-world impact through user studies and task-specific benchmarks on actual codebases.

### 1. Retrieval Evaluation (Finding the Right Code)

We assess the system's ability to accurately locate relevant code structures (e.g., functions, classes, dependencies) within the codebase graph (e.g., stored in Neo4j) based on user queries.

*   **Goal:** Check if the system finds the *correct* and *complete* set of code elements quickly.
*   **Metrics:**
    *   `Precision`: Measures the accuracy of the retrieved code pieces. Did it retrieve relevant items?
    *   `Recall`: Measures the completeness of the retrieval. Did it find *all* relevant items?
    *   `Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)`: Measures how quickly the *first* correct item is found, crucial for navigating code relationships.
*   **Process:**
    *   Define test queries mimicking developer needs (e.g., `"Explain the merge_sort function"`, `"What does the DataLoader class depend on?"`).
    *   Compare the system's retrieved code subgraphs against manually curated ground truth or expert consensus.
*   **Tools:** We may leverage frameworks like `RAGAS` which support retrieval metrics and can be adapted for graph contexts, especially useful given the challenge of generating exhaustive ground truth for large codebases.

### 2. Generation Evaluation (Assessing Generated Outputs)

We evaluate the quality, accuracy, and relevance of the outputs generated by the system (e.g., code explanations, documentation snippets, generated code).

*   **Goal:** Ensure generated content is accurate, faithful to the codebase, and helpful.
*   **Metrics:**
    *   `Faithfulness` (via RAGAS): Checks if the generated answer is grounded in the retrieved code context, minimizing "hallucinations".
    *   `Answer Relevance` (via RAGAS): Assesses if the answer directly addresses the user's query.
    *   `BLEU / ROUGE Scores`: Compares generated text (docs) or code snippets against reference examples for similarity and quality.
*   **Process:**
    *   Use tools like `RAGAS` for automated metrics where applicable.
    *   Supplement with human evaluation by developers to assess correctness, clarity, and utility, especially for complex explanations or generated code.
*   **Tools:** `RAGAS` is key for automated faithfulness and relevance checks without needing reference answers for every query.



### 3. Task-Specific Benchmarks (Performance on Real Code)

We test the system's performance on specific, realistic tasks using actual code repositories.

*   **Goal:** Validate the system's utility and accuracy on practical developer problems within real-world code.
*   **Metrics:**
    *   `Accuracy`: Task-specific correctness (e.g., correctly identifying all dependencies).
    *   `F1 Score / Exact Match (EM)`: Useful for tasks with precise answers, like code generation or specific information retrieval.
*   **Process:**
    *   Utilize open-source codebases (e.g., the [`TheAlgorithms/Python`](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python) repository) as a testbed.
    *   Formulate realistic developer queries against this codebase.
    *   Evaluate the system's output accuracy and relevance for these specific tasks.
    *   Compare performance against baselines (standard LLMs, vector-based RAG) to demonstrate the added value of the GraphRag approach.
