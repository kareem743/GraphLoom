## Project Overview
Our project focuses on integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to create a hybrid system for enhanced information retrieval and decision making in software engineering. Our system tries to improve accuracy and relevancy of selected tasks: code generation, explanation, and documentation with a focus on security for all of them. We aim to deliver precise, context-aware, and enriched responses to complex queries, thus bridging the gap between abstract AI capabilities and practical software development needs.
## Approach
The recommended approach leverages a hybrid methodology combining LLM inference and KG construction. This ensures the system benefits from structured knowledge (KG) and adaptive generative reasoning (LLM).
